Map of baby-friendly places in Prague & Czech Republic www.baby-friendly.cz

## About the project
### Background

Going out for a coffee or lunch can sometimes be a bit of a hassle. As parents, we realise that sometimes it takes a while to search the depths of the internet to find a place where your kids, and therefore you, will be able to have a good time. Thatâ€™s why I decided to create a user-friendly web app where anyone can easily search for an establishment with the use of baby-specific filters. 

This web was created as a final projext for Czechitas Digital Academy, however I am striving to continue developing it to serve as many parents as possible. 

### Built with

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/), JavaScript, CSS, HTML
