# Baby-friendly.cz

Map of baby-friendly places in Prague & Czech Republic

## Background

Going out for a coffee or lunch can sometimes be a bit of a hassle. As parents, we realise that sometimes it takes a while to search the depths of the internet to find a place where your kids, and therefore you, will be able to have a good time. Thatâ€™s why I decided to create a user-friendly web app where anyone can easily search for an establishment with the use of baby-specific filters. 

## Technologies used

React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

## Credits

This project wouldn't work without [react-map-gl](https://github.com/visgl/react-map-gl) and [Mapy.cz](https://api.mapy.cz/)

## Acknowledgments

This web was created as a final projext for Czechitas Digital Academy, however I am striving to continue developing it to serve as many parents as possible. 

A big thank you goes to my mentors and tutors who shared their expertise and dedicated a lot of time to answering my questions and coming up with working solutions.
